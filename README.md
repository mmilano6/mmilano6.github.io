Hi! I'm an kinesthetic thinker with a passion for investigating how average tasks can be made more satisfying through both robotic and software augmentation. This interest evolved from a my of love making design move. 

I was born in the District of Columbia, grew up in Maryland, and graduated from Maryland Institute College of Art with a BFA in graphic design. I then moved to Los Angeles in 2010, where I began working in the VFX and motion graphics industry. 

I've had the opportunity to work for clients like Disney Interactive and the La Brea Tar Pits, and done VFX on over twenty major motion pictures such as Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows part 1 and 2, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Mad Max: Fury Road. 

After realizing that animation and motion design wasn’t enough, I decided to pursue my Master of Fine Art in Media Design Practices at Art Center College of Design. My main focus was evolving my love for designing motion to a new medium. 

Most recently I have had the opportunity to show work at Ars Electronica and have work published by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

I’m excited about brewing creative and out of the box beers and ciders. I have an odd interest in lifting heavy things (I powerlift, don't worry I don’t go around trying to lift strangers).

My goal is to work on and produce high quality work that is unique and explores futuristic territories of user experience, robotics, and artificial intelligence.

Currently I am exploring what user experience for robots and AI would be.
